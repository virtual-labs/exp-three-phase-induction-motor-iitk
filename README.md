<b> Experiment|     <b> To study running & speed reversal of a 3-phase induction motor and record speed in both direction and Experiment 13

### About the Experiment 
Here in this experiment we used to study the clockwise and anticlockwise running of a three phase induction motor when we interchange any two phase from three power supply and calculte the speed of three phase induction motor in both direction. where we use aammeter ,a voltmeter and a techometer and autotransformer and a three phase induction motor and three pahse supply to perform this experiment here in this experiment we generally used the concept of phase change of three phase supply by interchanging the three phase supply we generally change the direction of the ddirection of torque actiong on it .
