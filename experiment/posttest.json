      "question": "1.The starting torque of a squirrel-cage induction motor is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Full-load torque",
        "b": "Slightly more than full-load torque",
        "c": "Low",
        "d": "Negligible"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Full-load torque is achieved once the motor reaches full speed. At startup, the torque is much lower.",
        "b": " Incorrect. Squirrel-cage motors typically have a lower starting torque compared to the full-load torque, not slightly more.",
        "c": " Correct. The starting torque of a squirrel-cage induction motor is relatively low due to low slip at startup and the impedance of the rotor winding.",
        "d": " Incorrect. Starting torque is not negligible, but it is lower than full-load torque, especially in standard squirrel-cage induction motors."

      "question": "2.A three-phase, 50 Hz induction motor has a full load speed of 1440 rpm. The full load slip will be?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "3",
        "b": "5",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "2"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The slip for a motor running at 1440 rpm would be higher than 3%. The motor is close to full-speed operation, so the slip would be a bit more than 2% and less than 5%.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A slip of 5% is higher than the typical value for a motor running at 1440 rpm with a synchronous speed of 1500 rpm.",
        "c": "Correct. At 1440 rpm, the motor is slightly slower than the synchronous speed of 1500 rpm (the speed at which the magnetic field rotates). The difference between the synchronous speed and actual speed is called the slip, and for this motor, it would be about 4% at full load.",
        "d": " Incorrect. A slip of 2% is too low for this motor with a full-load speed of 1440 rpm."

      "question": "3.Which of the following component is usually fabricated out of silicon steel?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stator core",
        "b": "Bearings",
        "c": "Shaft",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Correct. The stator core is fabricated from silicon steel due to its high magnetic permeability, which improves efficiency by reducing core losses (hysteresis and eddy currents).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bearings are typically made from materials like carbon steel or stainless steel for durability and smooth operation, not silicon steel.",
        "c": " Incorrect. The shaft is usually made from high-strength steel alloys, not silicon steel. Silicon steel is used for magnetic components, not mechanical ones like the shaft.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The stator core is made of silicon steel, so this option is incorrect."

      "question": " 4.The good power factor of an induction motor can be achieved if the average flux density in the air gap is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Infinity",
        "b": "Large",
        "c": "Absent",
        "d": "Small"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Incorrect. An infinite flux density is not possible and would lead to system failure, causing excessive losses and damage.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While a large flux density can increase the motor's performance, it can also lead to excessive iron losses and result in lower efficiency, negatively affecting the power factor.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Absent flux would make the motor inoperable. Without flux in the air gap, there would be no electromagnetic induction, and the motor wouldn't function.",
        "d": "Correct. A small but optimized flux density helps achieve a good power factor. It ensures the motor operates efficiently, with lower core losses and better energy conversion, improving the power factor."
