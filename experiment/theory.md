<h3> Theory </h3>
<p>When a 3-phase electric supply is given to this type of motor it does not require any starting device<br> <b>“3-Phase Induction motor is also called a Self-Starting device “ </b> <br>

Three phase induction motor mainly construct of two part –<br>
  <b>1.	Stator </b><br>
  <b>2.	Rotor</b><br>
  <b>Stator :</b> The stationary part of the motor is known as stator .it consist of a three phase winding which are termed as R, Y, B .<br>
  <b>Rotor :</b> The rotating part of a motor is known as rotor they are generally two type of rotor in 3-phase induction motor<br>
  <b>a)	Squirrel cage rotor</b> <br>
  <b>b)	Phase wound or wound rotor.</b><br>
  At time of starting 3-phase induction motor draw heavy current this current is reduced by reducing the starting voltage with the help of 3-phase autotransformer.

<p> <h4>Let’s understand the working of 3-phase induction motor </h4><p> <br>

Here R, Y, B are the phases of 3-phase induction motor <br>
For a clockwise rotation of motor we generally used positive sequence of (RYB) to a 3-phase winding where connection are given as –<br>
R is connected first terminal of autotransformer of starter , <br>
Y is connected to second terminal of autotransformer of starter ,<br>
B is connected to Third terminal of starter ,<br>
The total three output terminal are connected to 3 winding of three phase induction motor ,<br>
  <h2> Formula to be Used </h2>
  <b> Speed of rotor </b>
  <h4> Nr= (1-Es/Er)Ns </h4><br>
  where, Ns= 120f/p<br>
  Er= Running Voltage<br> 
  Es= starting voltage <br>
  f= 50Hz <br>
  Number of pole of motor = 4<br>
For measurement of voltage we simply connect two terminal input starter to voltmeter terminal .<br>
For measurement of current draw in motor we simply connected one terminal of ammeter to one input of starter terminal and one terminal of ammeter to one terminal of motor<br> 
By doing all this connection we simply power on and obtain a clockwise moving of a 3-phase induction motor .                                                                       To calculating the speed of 3-phase induction motor we mainly use “TECHOMETER”<br>

When 3-phase supply is given in negative sequence (RBY) to the three phase winding of stator of induction motor it produces rotating magnetic  field in anticlockwise direction .                                      therefore for reversing the direction of three phase induction motor we simply interchange any two terminal of 3-phase supply.<br>
  For obtaining the reversing running condition of a 3-phase induction motor we do all the connection in similar way but one thing we should to do this to just interchange of any two terminal of 3-phase supply of the system .<br>
