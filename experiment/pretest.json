      "question": "1) An 8-pole, 3-phase, 50 Hz induction motor is operating at a speed of 720 rpm. The frequency of the rotor current of the motor in Hz is __________",
      "answers": {
        "a": "2",
        "b": "4",
        "c": "3",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
           "a": "The rotor frequency is calculated as 2 Hz using slip and synchronous speed relation.",
           "b": "Incorrect. Rotor frequency is not 4 Hz. The correct value is 2 Hz.",
           "c": "Incorrect. The correct rotor frequency is 2 Hz, not 3 Hz.",
           "d": "Incorrect. The rotor frequency is 2 Hz, not 1 Hz."

      "question": "2) The frame of an induction motor is made of ______",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Aluminium",
        "b": "Silicon steel",
        "c": "Cast iron",
        "d": "Stainless steel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aluminium is light and corrosion-resistant but not commonly used for induction motor frames due to strength limitations.",
        "b": "Silicon steel is used for motor laminations, not the frame, as it enhances magnetic properties but lacks structural strength.",
        "c": "Cast iron is commonly used for motor frames due to its strength, durability, and ability to dissipate heat effectively.",
        "d": "Stainless steel is corrosion-resistant but is typically too expensive and heavy for use in motor frames."

      "question": "3) Slip ring of an induction motor is usually made up of",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Aluminium",
        "b": "Copper",
        "c": "Phosphorus Bronze",
        "d": "Carbon"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aluminium is light but lacks the necessary wear resistance and strength for slip rings.",
        "b": "Copper is a good conductor but not as durable as phosphorus bronze for slip rings.",
        "c": "Phosphorus bronze is corrosion-resistant, durable, and offers wear resistance, making it ideal for slip rings.",
        "d": "Carbon is used in motor brushes, not typically for constructing slip rings."

      "question": "4)A double squirrel-cage induction motor has",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Two series winding in stator",

        "c": "Two parallel winding in Rotor",
        "d": "Two rotors moving in opposite direction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A double squirrel-cage motor does not have two series windings in the stator.",
        "b": "The stator does not have two parallel windings in a double squirrel-cage induction motor.",
        "c": "The rotor has two cages: one outer with low reactance and one inner with high reactance.",
        "d": "A double squirrel-cage motor uses a single rotor, not two rotors moving in opposite directions."
