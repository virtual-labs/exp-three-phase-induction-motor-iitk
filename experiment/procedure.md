<b>Step 1</b> : To aware the connection diagram of the given system <br>
         3-Phase suplly --> input terminal of autotransformer<br>
         Two output terminal of autotransformer  --> two terminal of voltmeter <br>
         any two output terminal of autotransformer--> two terminal of motor <br>
         one output terminal of autotransformer --> one terminal of ammeter<br>
         one terminal of motor --> another terminal of ammeter<br>


<b>Step 2 </b>: Shift the MCB switch to start the power and note the phase. Initially itâ€™s in RBY phase and  can changed further. <br>
<b>Step 3 </b>: Put on the switch of Autotransformer to start the motor.<br>
<b>Step 4 </b>: Note the direction of rotor, which depends on the phase that we set using phase switch.<br>
<b>Step 5 </b>: Click on the TACHOMETER to obtain the speed of the motor and note it down<br>
<b>Step 6 </b> : Put off the switch of Autotransformer when you wish to stop the rotor.<br>
<b>Step 7 </b>: We can change the phase only by switching off the MCB.<br>
<b>Step 8 </b>: Repeat the steps from 2 to 6 and each time note the direction of rotor and RPM from Tachometer.<br>
